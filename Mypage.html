    “Climate change can make places inhabitable for humans” says the US government .  The major issues are that the earth has become 2.1 degrees faringhit according to NASA. NASA also says 429 billion metric tons of ice per year has melted.  During the 1970’s there was a huge spike up in temperature and people didn’t know why it was because of the fossil fuels that are all over the country then. There is a lot more like bye bye plastic bags and getting to 0 emissions by 2030 and the pacific garbage patch ect. Climate change is awful for the ecosystem.

        Climate change is when humans burn fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and fuel. Deforestation is also a big problem. Trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen which helps remove greenhouse gasses (mainly carbon dioxide) that get stuck in the atmosphere. Which traps the heat in the atmosphere and this has led to droughts and is more closed off or less known places can lead to water rationing and only a limited amount of water can be drunk. Insect breakouts affect the pest or insects that eat crops because they love the heat.  Along with extreme weather events like one day it could be snowing and the next it's a sunny day or the 4 weather events in the same day. Rising sea levels means some coastal houses can be destroyed even if they rise. According to NASA the ocean rises 3.3 millimeters per year. Just a little bit of salt water in arable land puts salt in it, which is not suitable for plants . This also affects the air quality with more carbon dioxide in the air and the less plants that convert carbon  dioxide into oxygen less and less of it is oxygen (which humans breathe).  The Pacific garbage patch is 50 year old garbage that weighs 80,000 tons. Because of this 100 million marine animals die each year because of this waste or 150 animals each day due to habitat loss and poaching and many other reasons .  even though it's a big patch, people still can't see it on google maps because it's mostly made out of micro garbage.

        Greta Thunburg is a teen activist who does not support climate change and she has Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and selective mutism. Which pretty much means that she only focuses on one topic and only talks when she feels the need to. She is only 18 and she is on her way to success. When she was 8 she could not understand why so little was being done about climate change and, as a result when she was 11 she stopped eating and in two months she lost 10 kilograms or 22 pounds. That's when she started fridays for future she stopped going to school on fridays and instead protested  outside of the sweedish parliament. In 2018 other school students protested with her. She also wants other activists to be known to work together and change the world. She has talked to many world leaders and was on ted talks and is now 1 step closer to her goal of getting 0 emissions in sweden.

    What can be done? Well a lot of things such as solar panels on your roof or could use a tesla roof tile that still makes it look good and it produces electric energy.  Hydraulic power is also an option if the community stream or river has a decent current even niagara falls has one to power all the lights that make it glow at night. Nuclear power is also an option you would have to build a nuclear fusion reactor but make sure to have a professional electrician advisor watching because it has lethal voltage levels   or just use less plastic and get biodegradable things like paper plates.  Or write to the government to charge money for pollution but the simplest of them all help other teen activists.

        The skeleton you see went extinct because of climate change. It is the indian cheetah. Climate change is awful for the ecosystem. You should have taken away that Greta and other teen activists do a lot in the world and you also should have caught on to what can be done. Really analyze what strategies you can use to help save the environment and you also should have caught how climate change is happening . This topic is important because like the US Government said some places might be inhabitable by humans.
